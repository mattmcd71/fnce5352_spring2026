## Materials

- Course materials and code:
  - https://github.com/mattmcd71/fnce5352_spring2025

- This lecture:
  - **Master conceptual deck for Lecture 2**
  - Implementation details live in supporting decks and demo scripts

::: notes
This is the organizing lecture.
Transform and visualize decks are references and deep dives.

## Where We Are in the Workflow

![](img/model-workflow.png)

- Import → **Tidy → Explore** → Model → Communicate
- Today: **Tidy + Explore**
- Modeling comes *next*

::: notes
Lecture 1 framed the workflow.
Lecture 2 fills in the most commonly skipped steps.
:::

## What Modeling Textbooks Assume

- Observations are well-defined
- Variables are clearly represented
- Data is already analysis-ready

::: notes
This is usually unstated in ISLR.
We are making the assumption explicit.
:::

## What This Course Makes Explicit

- Data must be:
  - tidy
  - interpretable
  - transformed with intent
- Visualization is not decoration
  - it is informal model assessment

::: notes
This is the intellectual justification for today.
:::

## Tidy Data as Modeling Infrastructure

![](img/tidyverse.png)

- One observation per row
- One variable per column
- One dataset per analytical unit

::: notes
This maps directly to ISLR’s notion of observations and predictors.
:::

## The Role of the Tidyverse

- Tools for:
  - transforming raw data into predictors
  - structuring datasets for modeling
  - exploring relationships *before* fitting models
- Focused on clarity and workflow, not cleverness

::: notes
We are not optimizing.
We are preparing to think clearly.
:::

## Supporting Material

- **Data Transformation**
  - constructing variables and comparisons
- **Data Visualization**
  - understanding distributions and relationships
- Live demos:
  - AAPL + SPY for continuity

::: notes
We will move between this deck and those decks.
This deck is the spine.
