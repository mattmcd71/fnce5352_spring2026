## Where We Are in the Workflow

![](img/model-workflow.png)

-   Import → Tidy → **Visualize → Transform** → Model 
-   Today: **Visualize → Transform**
-   Modeling comes later

::: notes
Lecture 1 framed the overall data science workflow. Lecture 2 focuses on the parts that are most often skipped or rushed.
:::

## What Analysis Textbooks Assume

-   observations are well-defined
-   variables are clearly represented
-   data is already analysis-ready

::: notes
This assumption is usually implicit in textbooks like ISLR. We are making it explicit so we can address it directly.
:::

## What This Course Makes Explicit

-   data must be:
    -   tidy
    -   interpretable
    -   constructed with intent
-   visualization is a thinking tool
    -   not decoration

::: notes
Most of the real intellectual work happens before formal analysis. This lecture explains what that work looks like.
:::

## What Is the Tidyverse?

![](img/tidyverse.png)

-   opinionated collection of R packages
-   consistent data structures and verbs
-   designed for data preparation and exploration

::: notes
The tidyverse is a coherent ecosystem, not a random set of packages. Its consistency lowers cognitive overhead and supports clear analytical thinking.
:::

## The Role of the Tidyverse

-   structuring data for analysis
-   constructing meaningful variables
-   exploring patterns and variation

::: notes
The tidyverse supports thinking clearly about data. It prepares inputs for later analysis rather than performing modeling itself.
:::

## ISLR’s View of Data

-   observations
-   variables
-   outcomes

::: notes
ISLR presents data as rows and columns: observations with associated variables and outcomes. It treats this structure as given.
:::

## What ISLR Leaves Unsaid

-   how observations are defined
-   how variables are constructed
-   how datasets are assembled

::: notes
In practice, these steps take most of the time. In finance, aligning time series and defining units of analysis are nontrivial decisions.
:::

## Tidy Data Defines Observations

-   what does one row represent?
-   what is the unit of analysis?
-   what comparisons are valid?

::: notes
Tidy data forces us to be explicit about what an observation is. If you cannot explain what one row represents, you cannot reason clearly about the data.
:::

## Transformation Creates Variables

-   variables are constructed, not given
-   scale and representation matter
-   transformations encode meaning

::: notes
Prices become returns, levels become changes, and time becomes lags or aggregates. These are analytical choices, not mechanical steps.
:::

## Exploration Reveals Structure

-   distributions and scale
-   relationships between variables
-   variation across time and groups

::: notes
Before formal analysis, we look. Plots help us understand what varies, what is related, and what is unusual.
:::

## How These Pieces Fit Together

-   tidy data clarifies observations
-   transformation defines variables
-   exploration builds intuition

::: notes
These steps form an iterative loop. We often reshape, transform, and explore repeatedly as understanding improves.
:::

## How We’ll Spend the Rest of Today

-   exploratory visualization
-   data wrangling and transformation
-   revisiting questions with cleaner structure

::: notes
We will first focus on visualization to see what questions arise. Then we will work on transforming and restructuring data to support those questions.
