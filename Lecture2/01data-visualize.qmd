## Loading the Tidyverse

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
One line of code loads the core tidyverse; packages which you will use in almost every data analysis.

It also tells you which functions from the tidyverse conflict with functions in base R (or from other packages you might have loaded).
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
```
:::
:::::

## Explicit Calls to packages

If we need to be explicit about where a function (or dataset) comes from, we'll use the special form `package::function()`.

For example, `ggplot2::ggplot()` tells you explicitly that we're using the `ggplot()` function from the ggplot2 package.

## First steps {.smaller}

First Question: Do cars with big engines use more fuel than cars with small engines?

You probably already have an answer, but try to make your answer precise.

-   What does the relationship between engine size and fuel efficiency look like?
-   Is it positive?
-   Negative?
-   Linear?
-   Nonlinear?

## The `mpg` data frame {.smaller}

You can test your answer with the `mpg` **data frame** found in ggplot2 (a.k.a. `ggplot2::mpg`).

A data frame is a rectangular collection of variables (in the columns) and observations (in the rows).

`mpg` contains observations collected by the US Environmental Protection Agency on 38 models of car.

```{r}
mpg
```

## Creating a ggplot

```{r}
#| output-location: default
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

## ggplot call {.smaller}

With ggplot2, you begin a plot with the function `ggplot()`.

-   `ggplot()` creates a coordinate system that you can add layers to.
-   The first argument of `ggplot()` is the dataset to use in the graph.
-   `ggplot(data = mpg)` creates an empty graph

Complete your graph by adding one or more layers to `ggplot()`.

-   The function `geom_point()` adds a layer of points to your plot, which creates a scatterplot.

## mapping argument

Each geom function in ggplot2 takes a `mapping` argument.

-   This defines how variables in your dataset are mapped to visual properties of your plot.

The `mapping` argument is always paired with `aes()`, and the `x` and `y` arguments of `aes()` specify which variables to map to the x and y axes.

-   ggplot2 looks for the mapped variables in the `data` argument, in this case, `mpg`.

## A graphing template

```{r}
#| eval: false

ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))
```

## Aesthetic mappings (1)

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
In this plot, one group of points (highlighted in red) seems to fall outside of the linear trend.

These cars have a higher mileage than you might expect.

How can you explain these cars?
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-height: 4

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_point(data = dplyr::filter(mpg, displ > 5, hwy > 20), colour = "red")
```
:::
:::::

## Aesthetic mappings (2)

You can add a third variable, like `class`, to a two dimensional scatterplot by mapping it to an **aesthetic**.

An aesthetic is a visual property of the objects in your plot.

```{r}
#| output-location: default
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-height: 3

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))

```

## Facets {.smaller}

Another way, particularly useful for categorical (aka factor) variables, is to split your plot into **facets**, subplots that each display one subset of the data.

To facet your plot by a single variable, use `facet_wrap()`.

The first argument of `facet_wrap()` is a formula, which you create with `~` followed by a variable name (here, "formula" is the name of a data structure in R, not a synonym for "equation").

The variable that you pass to `facet_wrap()` should be discrete.

## facet_wrap()

```{r}
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 4
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
```

## facet_grid() {.smaller}

To facet your plot on the combination of two variables, add `facet_grid()` to your plot call. The first argument of `facet_grid()` is also a formula containing two variable names separated by a `~`.

```{r}
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 4
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)
```

## How are these two plots similar? {.smaller}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-height: 4
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-height: 4
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) 
```
:::
:::::

## Geometric Objects {.smaller}

Each plot uses a different visual object to represent the data. In ggplot2 syntax, we say that they use different **geoms**.

A **geom** is the geometrical object that a plot uses to represent data.

For example, bar charts use bar geoms, line charts use line geoms, boxplots use boxplot geoms, and so on. Scatterplots break the trend; they use the point geom.

Every geom function in ggplot2 takes a `mapping` argument. However, not every aesthetic works with every geom. You could set the shape of a point, but you couldn't set the "shape" of a line. On the other hand, you *could* set the linetype of a line.

## geom_smooth() {.smaller}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
`geom_smooth()` will draw a different line, with a different linetype, for each unique value of the variable that you map to linetype.

Here `geom_smooth()` separates the cars into three lines based on their `drv` value, which describes a car's drive train.

Here, `4` stands for four-wheel drive, `f` for front-wheel drive, and `r` for rear-wheel drive.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| message: false
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-height: 4
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, 
                            y = hwy, 
                            linetype = drv))
```
:::
:::::

## Coloring by drive {.smaller}

If this sounds strange, we can make it more clear by overlaying the lines on top of the raw data and then colouring everything according to `drv`.

```{r}
#| echo: false
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(linetype = drv)) 
```

## More Geoms {.smaller}

ggplot2 provides over 40 geoms, and extension packages provide even more (see <https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/> for a sampling).

The best way to get a comprehensive overview is the ggplot2 cheatsheet, which you can find at <http://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets>.

To learn more about any single geom, use help, e.g. `?geom_smooth`.

## Grouping {.smaller}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-height: 4
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, 
                            y = hwy, 
                            group = drv))
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-height: 4
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ,
                            y = hwy, 
                            color = drv),
    show.legend = FALSE)
```
:::
:::::

## Multiple Geoms in Same Plot

To display multiple geoms in the same plot, add multiple geom functions to `ggplot()`:

```{r}
#| message: false
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 3
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

This, however, introduces some duplication in our code.

## Global Mappings

You can avoid this type of repetition by passing a set of mappings to `ggplot()`. ggplot2 will treat these mappings as global mappings that apply to each geom in the graph. In other words, this code will produce the same plot as the previous code:

```{r}
#| eval: false
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()

```

## Layer-Specific Mappings {.smaller}

If you place mappings in a geom function, ggplot2 will treat them as local mappings for the layer. It will use these mappings to extend or overwrite the global mappings *for that layer only*. This makes it possible to display different aesthetics in different layers.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 3
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = class)) + 
  geom_smooth()
```

## Layer-Specific Data {.smaller}

You can use the same idea to specify different `data` for each layer. Here, our smooth line displays just a subset of the `mpg` dataset, the subcompact cars. The local data argument in `geom_smooth()` overrides the global data argument in `ggplot()` for that layer only.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 3
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = class)) + 
  geom_smooth(data = filter(mpg, class == "subcompact"), se = FALSE)
```

## Bar Charts {.smaller}

The following chart displays the total number of diamonds in the `diamonds` dataset (a dataset included in ggplot2), grouped by `cut`. The chart shows that more diamonds are available with high quality cuts than with low quality cuts.

```{r}
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 3
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut))
```

## Bar Charts (2) {.smaller}

On the x-axis, the chart displays `cut`, a variable from `diamonds`.

On the y-axis, it displays count, but count is not a variable in `diamonds`!

Where does count come from?

Many graphs, like scatterplots, plot the raw values of your dataset.

Other graphs, like bar charts, calculate new values to plot:

-   bar charts, histograms, and frequency polygons bin your data and then plot bin counts, the number of points that fall in each bin.

-   smoothers fit a model to your data and then plot predictions from the model.

-   boxplots compute a robust summary of the distribution and then display a specially formatted box.

## What if my data **does** include count data? {.smaller}

```{r}
#| output-location: column
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-height: 4
demo <- tribble(
  ~cut,         ~freq,
  "Fair",       1610,
  "Good",       4906,
  "Very Good",  12082,
  "Premium",    13791,
  "Ideal",      21551
)

ggplot(data = demo) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, 
                         y = freq), 
           stat = "identity")
```

## Color Aesthetic

There's one more piece of magic associated with bar charts.

You can colour a bar chart using either the `color` aesthetic

```{r}
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 4
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, color = cut))
```

## Fill Aesthetic

The Fill Aesthetic is more useful

```{r}
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 4
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = cut))
```

## Stacking {.smaller}

Note what happens if you map the fill aesthetic to another variable, like `clarity`: the bars are automatically stacked.

Each colored rectangle represents a combination of `cut` and `clarity`.

```{r}
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 4
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity))
```

## Position Argument

The stacking is performed automatically by the **position adjustment** specified by the `position` argument. If you don't want a stacked bar chart, you can use one of three other options: `"identity"`, `"dodge"` or `"fill"`.

## Position = 'fill' {.smaller}

`position = "fill"` works like stacking, but makes each set of stacked bars the same height.

This makes it easier to compare proportions across groups.

```{r}
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 4
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity), position = "fill")
```

## Position = 'dodge' {.smaller}

`position = "dodge"` places overlapping objects directly *beside* one another.

This makes it easier to compare individual values.

```{r}
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 4
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity), position = "dodge")
```

## Position = 'jitter' {.smaller}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-height: 4
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, 
                           y = hwy))
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-height: 4
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, 
                           y = hwy), 
             position = "jitter")
```
:::
:::::

## Coordinate systems {.smaller}

Coordinate systems are probably the most complicated part of ggplot2.

The default coordinate system is the Cartesian coordinate system where the x and y positions act independently to determine the location of each point.

There are a number of other coordinate systems that are occasionally helpful.

-   `coord_flip()` switches the x and y axes.
-   `coord_quickmap()` sets the aspect ratio correctly for maps.
-   `coord_polar()` uses polar coordinates.

## The layered grammar of graphics {.smaller}

Here is an updated template for ggplot code:

```         
ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(
     mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>),
     stat = <STAT>, 
     position = <POSITION>
  ) +
  <COORDINATE_FUNCTION> +
  <FACET_FUNCTION>
```

The new template takes seven parameters, the bracketed words that appear in the template.

In practice, you rarely need to supply all seven parameters to make a graph because ggplot2 will provide useful defaults for everything except the data, the mappings, and the geom function.

The seven parameters in the template compose the grammar of graphics, a formal system for building plots.

The grammar of graphics is based on the insight that you can uniquely describe *any* plot as a combination of a dataset, a geom, a set of mappings, a stat, a position adjustment, a coordinate system, and a faceting scheme.
