# Course Framing

## The Core Idea

**Most financial questions aren’t about the “right” answer.**

They’re about making the **best decision**  
given **noise, uncertainty, and tradeoffs**.

::: notes
This is the thesis of the course.
Pause after the first line.
Emphasize that finance lives in uncertainty, not closed-form answers.
Use this to pivot from “who I am” to “why this course is structured the way it is.”
:::

## What This Course Is — And Isn’t

**This course is not**
- learning every algorithm
- optimizing models for their own sake

**This course is**
- applied statistical learning for finance
- regression and classification
- interpretation and model assessment
- understanding tradeoffs (accuracy vs robustness, simplicity vs flexibility)

::: notes
Stress that depth of understanding matters more than breadth.
This sets expectations early and lowers anxiety.
:::

## Tools And Transfer

The **ideas** matter more than the language.

- Part 1 uses **R** (lecture language)
- Part 2 uses **Python**
- Assignments may be completed in either language
- The workflow and concepts transfer directly across both

::: notes
Reinforce portability: if they understand the workflow here,
Python later should feel familiar rather than intimidating.
:::

# The Data Science And Modeling Workflow  
*(Finance-First)*

## The Workflow We Will Use All Semester

![](images/ModelingWorkflow.png){.r-stretch}

This is not a one-time sequence.  
It’s a **loop** you will revisit constantly.

::: notes
This is the backbone of the course.
Everything we do in R this semester fits somewhere in this loop.
Emphasize that we will cycle through it repeatedly, not march through it once.
:::

## Why This Is A Loop (Not A Checklist)

- New data arrives
- Assumptions change
- Results raise new questions
- Decisions require iteration

In finance, the workflow rarely ends.

::: notes
Stress iteration and feedback.
Connect to real-world finance: markets move, regimes change, models decay.
This motivates reproducibility and disciplined workflows.
:::

## What Each Step Looks Like In Finance

- **Import**  
  Prices, returns, fundamentals, loan tapes, macro series  

- **Tidy**  
  Dates, joins, missing data, panel structure  

- **Explore**  
  Distributions, correlations, regime changes  

- **Model**  
  Regression and classification to support decisions  

- **Communicate**  
  Plots, narrative, and a clear “so what?”

::: notes
Walk through quickly.
Reinforce that modeling is only one part of the workflow.
Communication is where analysis becomes a decision.
:::


# R And Python: Portability

## The Key Claim

> **If you understand what we’re doing in R,  
> you’ll recognize it instantly in Python.**

::: notes
Say this slowly and confidently.
The goal is to reduce anxiety about the second half of the course.
Emphasize that we are teaching ideas and workflows, not syntax trivia.
:::

## What Actually Transfers

- Data frames / tables  
- Functions, objects, and libraries  
- Wrangle → visualize → model → evaluate  
- Train / test thinking (coming soon)

::: notes
Point out that the *verbs* and *structure* stay the same.
R syntax changes to Python syntax, but the workflow does not.
This sets up Part 2 cleanly.
:::

# RStudio Orientation  
*(Minimum Viable Comfort)*

## R vs RStudio

- **R** = the engine  
- **RStudio** = the interface  

![](images/RvsRStudio.png){.r-stretch}

::: notes
Keep this high level.
R is the language and computation engine.
RStudio is the environment that makes R usable: editor, console, plots, files, help.
Do not list features yet — this is orientation, not a tour.
:::

## Packages

![](images/RPackagesAsApps.png){.r-stretch}

::: notes
Use the phone analogy here.

R by itself is like a new phone:
- it turns on
- it can do a few basic things
- but it isn’t very useful yet

Packages are the apps you install on the phone.
install.packages() is downloading an app.
library() is opening the app.

Most of what we do this semester is learning:
- which “apps” to use
- and when to use them.
:::

## Projects (Strongly Recommended)

- One folder per project  
- Relative paths  
- Easier reproducibility  

::: notes
Emphasize that projects prevent path problems.
This sets up why data lives in data/ and why here::here() exists later.
Students don’t need to understand this deeply yet — just accept it.
:::

## RStudio Walkthrough (Live)

::: notes
This is a live, interactive walkthrough.
Show the four panes:
- Source (scripts)
- Console (where code runs)
- Environment / History
- Files / Plots / Packages / Help

Demonstrate:
- creating a new script
- running a single line (Cmd/Ctrl + Enter)
- running multiple lines
- clearing the console
- where plots appear
- where errors show up

Keep this informal.
Encourage students to follow along.
Reassure them that it’s normal to feel lost at first.
:::

# Hands-On Workflow Demo  
*(AAPL + SPY)*

## Live Coding In RStudio

::: notes
Switch from slides to RStudio here.

Follow the workflow explicitly:
- Import: read aapl_spy.csv
- Tidy: clean columns, dates, and structure
- Explore: prices over time
- Transform: compute daily returns
- Explore again: return distributions
- (Optional teaser) Model: simple market regression

Narrate what you’re doing and why.
Do not rush.
Encourage students to follow along, but reassure them they don’t need to type everything perfectly.

This is where the workflow slide comes to life.
:::

## What We Just Did

![](images/ModelingWorkflow.png){.r-stretch}

::: notes
Re-anchor everything to the workflow loop.
Point out that modeling will come later.

# ISL Chapter 1 (conceptual)

> **This chapter is about how we talk about models, not how we compute them.**

## Vocabulary we’ll use all semester

- statistical learning
- prediction vs inference
- training vs test performance (intuition today)
- overfitting (why “looks great in-sample” can be a trap)
- tradeoffs (accuracy vs interpretability; complexity vs robustness)

# Wrap Up

## {data-background-image="images/HowToAccessGit.png" data-background-size="contain" data-background-position="center" data-background-repeat="no-repeat"}

## Next Steps

- Read: R4DS Sections 1–8
- Read: ISL Chapter 1 (conceptual)
- Make sure you can run code and re-render slides
